    "The actual model is created by the next code snippet, which declares a Sequential model. We are now working with a 2D convolutional layer, so there is no need to start with a Flatten layer because the dimensions of the input image already match the required dimension of the first layer. We tell the layer that the input image has 3 channels and we want the layer to output 64 channels. We also state that we want a kernel size of 5×5, a stride of 2x2. Finally, we state that we want to pad the image with 2 pixels on each side, which in combination with the 5x5 kernel size and 2x2 stride will result in the output resolution being half of the resolution of the input image. That is, the output of the layer will be 16x16 neurons per channel. We specify the neuron type as ReLU because that has been shown to be a good activation function.\n",

    "The next convolutional layer is similar but with a smaller kernel size. The number of input channels (64) must match the number of output channels from the previous layer. The number of neurons per channel is implicitly defined as 8×8 because the previous layer was 16×16 outputs per channel, and we choose a stride of 2x2 for this layer as well. We set padding to 1 since our kernel size is 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can add the fully connected (Linear) layer, we need to flatten (convert from three dimensions to a single dimension) the outputs from the second convolutional layer. We compute the number of inputs for this layer as 64x8x8 (the previous convolutional layer was 64 channels and 8x8 neurons per channel). We use softmax activation for the fully connected layer so we can interpret the one-hot encoded outputs as probabilities.\n",
